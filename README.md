# 🎛️ Queuing Simulation in Computer Networks

This project simulates three different **queuing systems** in a computer network. It models traffic generated by multiple sources with **ON/OFF behavior** following exponential distribution, and simulates how packets are handled based on the queuing strategy.

## 📡 Simulation Overview

- **Traffic Sources**: Audio, Video, and Data streams.
- **ON/OFF Model**: Each source has mean ON and OFF times following an **exponential distribution**.
- **Serving Capacity**: **10 Mbps** (server processes 10 million bits per second).
- **Control Offered Load**: By varying the number of sources (`Na`, `Nv`, `Nd`).

## 📋 Source Characteristics

| Source Type | Peak Bit Rate (kbps) | Mean ON Time (s) | Mean OFF Time (s) | Packet Size (bytes) | Number of Sources |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Audio**   | 64                   | 0.36             | 0.64              | 120                  | `Na` (variable)     |
| **Video**   | 384                  | 0.33             | 0.73              | 1000                 | `Nv` (variable)     |
| **Data**    | 256                  | 0.35             | 0.65              | 583                  | `Nd` (variable)     |

## 🧮 Queuing Systems Simulated

### 1. FIFO – First In First Out

- **Single queue** with a capacity of **3 MB**.
- **First come, first served**.
- Packets are **discarded** if the queue is full at arrival time.

---

### 2. SPQ – Strict Priority Queueing

- **Three separate queues**, one for each source type:
  - Each queue has a capacity of **1 MB**.
- Packets are routed to queues by type.
- **Higher priority queues are always served first**.
- Packets are dropped if their corresponding queue is full.

---

### 3. WFQ – Weighted Fair Queuing

- Same three-queue structure as SPQ.
- Queues have **weights** to control fairness:
  - Audio: **0.5**
  - Video: **0.3**
  - Data: **0.2**
- **Real-time weights** are calculated to approach the target weights.
- Queues are served proportionally to these weights over time.

---

## ⚙️ Usage

- Configure the number of each source (`Na`, `Nv`, `Nd`) to simulate different traffic loads.
- Analyze queue behavior, packet drops, and service fairness under different queuing algorithms.

---

## 📈 Goals

- Evaluate performance under different traffic intensities.
- Compare packet drop rates, fairness, and bandwidth utilization across queuing methods.
